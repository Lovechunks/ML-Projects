    "The Wine Quality-Red dataset comes from the University of California, School of Information and Computer Science Machine Learning Repository (Cortez et al., 2009) and is one of two datasets created by a team of researchers to determine characteristics related to wine quality in both red and white wines. Both datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese \"Vinho Verde\" wine.\n",

    "Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available, so we don't know what grapes are used or which brands participated. What we do have is the qualitative evaluation of many anonymous wines and their particular chemical characteristics. These include fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol and finaly quality.\n",
